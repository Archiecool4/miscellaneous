# Miscellaneous
These are just some random things I coded in my free time.

- C
  - bootstrap.c: I coded statistical bootstrapping to determine the distribution in which C picks values for its rand() function. 
    I sampled values between 0 and 10000 and got a Gaussian distribution nearly perfectly centered at 5000, as seen in the included
    graph.
