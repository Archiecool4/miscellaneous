# Miscellaneous
These are just some random things I coded in my free time.

- C
  - bootstrap.c: I coded statistical bootstrapping to determine the distribution in which C picks values for its rand() function. 
    I sampled 100 values between 0 and 10000, bootstrapped 100000 times, and got a Gaussian distribution nearly perfectly centered 
    at 5000, as seen in the included graph.
- JavaScript
 - snake.html: I coded a simple JavaScript snake inspired by the [Coding "Snake" in 4 min 30 sec (plain browser JavaScript)]   (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs) YouTube video. I coded it with different data structures in my own style and added pause and restart functionality, as well as other minor tweaks.
